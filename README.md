# APIComparator
Java program that will compare the Two API JSON Responses. 
There will be two Rest API URLs which will have individual user IDs, cookies and request jsons. 
Please have a method to call the Rest API with the user, and a cookie in the header with the request JSON. 
Once you get the response JSON from Rest APIs have a compare method that will compare the jsons from each response and see what the values are different. 
If the response has an e2eid tag and its value is different in the response json please don't log, please log all other flags. 
Please track how long it takes to make each API request and log that time.
